# Receipt Data Extraction, Parsing, and Expenses Analysis Project

In this project, I developed a comprehensive system for receipt data extraction, parsing, and expense analysis using LLM capabilities. 

## Hosted Application
The application is hosted on Hugging Face Hub and can be tested there. Simply upload your OpenAI API key and photos of receipts. You can access the app using the following link: 


Below is a breakdown of the key files and components:

## Files
1. **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the necessary dependencies. To install them, use the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **code.py**: Contains the main logic and functions for OCR, data extraction, and visualization.
3. **app.py**: Runs the Gradio app interface for user interaction.
4. **experiments.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with experiments and evaluations conducted to choose the proper algorithms and models.

## Project Overview
### 1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with PaddleOCR:
- Utilized computer vision techniques and the PaddleOCR library for efficient text extraction from receipt images.
- Configured the PaddleOCR model for the Spanish language and enabled GPU acceleration for faster processing.

### 2. Structured Data Extraction using GPT-3.5-turbo API:
- Defined a Pydantic schema to represent the structured data format for receipts.
- Integrated with LangChain's with_structured_output method to pass the schema and leverage the GPT-3.5-turbo API for structured output generation.
- Applied few-shot inference techniques to ensure accurate extraction and categorization of receipt information.

### 3. Data Processing and Analysis:
- Transformed the extracted data into a well-structured JSON object representing various aspects of the receipt, including store details, itemized purchases, dates, and payment methods.
- Utilized Pandas for data manipulation, enabling seamless conversion of structured data into DataFrame format for analysis.

### 4. Interactive Visualization Dashboards with Plotly:
- Developed interactive visualization dashboards using Plotly for charting.
- Enabled users to explore and analyze expense trends, category-wise spending, and budget tracking in a user-friendly interface.
  
### 5. Interactive Web Interface with Gradio
- Implemented features for users to upload multiple receipts, edit, and confirm receipt data, enhancing usability and accuracy.
- Developed the Gradio app interface to facilitate easy user interaction.

### 6. Technologies Used:
- Python: Leveraged Python programming language for all development tasks.
- PaddleOCR: Integrated PaddleOCR library for OCR functionality, enabling accurate text extraction from receipt images.
- Pydantic: Defined a schema for structured data representation, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- LangChain with GPT-3.5-turbo API: Employed LangChain's capabilities along with GPT-3.5-turbo API for structured output generation and few-shot inference.
- Pandas: Utilized Pandas library for data manipulation and DataFrame operations.
- Plotly: Developed interactive visualization dashboards using Plotly for charting.
- Gradio: Created an interactive web interface for users to upload, edit, and confirm receipt data.
